<p>This week I became aware of the R package blogdown (<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown</a>), which was released on CRAN on 2017-08-22 (see <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown</a> and the announcement <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown" class="uri">https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown</a>). Initially, given the name, I presumed that it was an R package that facilitated the creation of a blog. But it is much more than that.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming aware of blogdown, I had been using reproducible tools coincidentally created by the author of blogdown which were designed for creating sophisticated products including books, research papers, and websites with an eye on reproducibility (<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown</a>). A key feature of R Markdown and bookdown is that you work with one file only, the file is a human readable Markdown script, and you remain agnostic about the output format; you can render the output in a range of formats from PDF/<span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> to MS Word to HTML etc., which are rendered using pandoc (<a href="http://pandoc.org" class="uri">http://pandoc.org</a>). These tools have become an indispensable part of my workflow.</p>
<p>However, markdown and bookdown are referred to as “formal” while blogdown is referred to as “casual” by its creator, so they are intended for different audiences; blogdown is designed strictly for the creation of websites. I have been using markdown to create websites, and that works brilliantly but is perhaps overkill. But blogdown adopts Hugo (<a href="https://gohugo.io" class="uri">https://gohugo.io</a>) and provides disqus support (<a href="https://disqus.com" class="uri">https://disqus.com</a>) and allows you to get up to speed creating static sites in an open and free environment, accomplished by using GitHub (<a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a>) and netlify (<a href="https://www.netlify.com" class="uri">https://www.netlify.com</a>).</p>
<p>This site was created using blogdown, and you can clone this project from my GitHub page and modify to suit your needs (<a href="https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/static-hugo-site" class="uri">https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/static-hugo-site</a>). I found the blogdown tutorial by Peter Baumgartner to be most valuable (<a href="https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net" class="uri">https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net</a>). By following his instructions I was up and running in no time.</p>
