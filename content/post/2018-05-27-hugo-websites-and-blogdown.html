<p>This week I became aware of the R package blogdown (<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown</a>), which was released on CRAN on 2017-08-22 (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown</a>). Initially, given the name, I presumed that it was an R package that facilitated the creation of a blog. But it is much more than that. Previously I was using reproducible tools by the author of blogdown (<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown</a>) which can be used to create sophisticated products including books, research papers, and websites with an eye on reproducibility.</p>
<p>However, markdown and bookdown are referred to as “formal” while blogdown is referred to as “casual” by its creator, so they are intended for different audiences. I have been using markdown to create websites, and that works brilliantly. But blogdown adopts Hugo (<a href="https://gohugo.io" class="uri">https://gohugo.io</a>) and provides disqus support (<a href="https://disqus.com" class="uri">https://disqus.com</a>) and allows you to get up to speed creating static sites in an open and free environment, accomplished by using GitHub (<a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a>) and netlify (<a href="https://www.netlify.com" class="uri">https://www.netlify.com</a>).</p>
<p>This site was created using blogdown, and you can clone this project from my GitHub page and modify to suit your needs (<a href="https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/static-hugo-site" class="uri">https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/static-hugo-site</a>). I found the blogdown tutorial by Peter Baumgartner to be most valuable (<a href="https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net" class="uri">https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net</a>).</p>
