<p>This week I became aware of the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown">blogdown</a>, which was <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown">released on CRAN on 2017-08-22</a> with the <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown">announcement</a> following shortly thereafter. Initially, given the name, I presumed that it was an R package that facilitated the creation of a blog. But it is much more than that.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming aware of blogdown, I had been using reproducible tools coincidentally created by the author of blogdown which were designed for creating sophisticated products including books, research papers, and websites with an eye on reproducibility (<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown">bookdown</a>). A key feature of R Markdown and bookdown is that you work with one file only, the file is a human readable Markdown script, and you remain agnostic about the output format; you can render the output in a range of formats from PDF/<span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> to MS Word to HTML etc., which are rendered using <a href="http://pandoc.org">pandoc</a>. These tools have become an indispensable part of my workflow.</p>
<p>However, markdown and bookdown are referred to as “formal” while blogdown is referred to as “casual” by its creator, so they are intended for different audiences; blogdown is designed strictly for the creation of websites. I have been using markdown to create websites, and that works brilliantly but is perhaps overkill. But blogdown adopts <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and provides <a href="https://disqus.com">disqus</a> support and allows you to get up to speed creating static sites in an open and free environment, accomplished by using <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com">netlify</a>.</p>
<p>This site was created using blogdown, and you can clone this project from its <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/static-hugo-site">GitHub page</a> and modify to suit your needs. I found the <a href="https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net">blogdown tutorial</a> by Peter Baumgartner to be most valuable. By following his instructions I was up and running in no time.</p>
