This week I became aware of the R package blogdown (https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown), which was released on CRAN on 2017-08-22 (see https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blogdown and the announcement https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown). Initially, given the name, I presumed that it was an R package that facilitated the creation of a blog. But it is much more than that. 

Prior to becoming aware of blogdown, I had been using reproducible tools coincidentally created by the author of blogdown which were designed for creating sophisticated products including books, research papers, and websites with an eye on reproducibility (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com and https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown). A key feature of R Markdown and bookdown is that you work with one file only, the file is a human readable Markdown script, and you remain agnostic about the output format; you can render the output in a range of formats from PDF/\(\LaTeX\) to MS Word to HTML etc., which are rendered using pandoc (http://pandoc.org). These tools have become an indispensable part of my workflow.

However, markdown and bookdown are referred to as "formal" while blogdown is referred to as "casual" by its creator, so they are intended for different audiences; blogdown is designed strictly for the creation of websites. I have been using markdown to create websites, and that works brilliantly but is perhaps overkill. But blogdown adopts Hugo (https://gohugo.io) and provides disqus support (https://disqus.com) and allows you to get up to speed creating static sites in an open and free environment, accomplished by using GitHub (https://github.com) and netlify (https://www.netlify.com).

This site was created using blogdown, and you can clone this project from my GitHub page and modify to suit your needs (https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/static-hugo-site). I found the blogdown tutorial by Peter Baumgartner to be most valuable (https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net). By following his instructions I was up and running in no time.
