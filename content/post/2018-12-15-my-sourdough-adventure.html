<p>Every once in a while I find myself daydreaming about various ways to up my game in the kitchen and, recently, that dream morphed into an obsession over trying to bake <em>seriously good bread</em> in a home kitchen. But not just any bread: <em>sourdough bread</em>.</p>
<p>As strange as it may seem, my bread obsession was triggered by another obsession, namely, knives and knife sharpening. Until recently, our kitchen knives were not all that sharp—I have had them ever since I was a graduate student, which dates their purchase to sometime during the Paleozoic Era. To maintain their edges I sharpened them with a Henckels pull-through ceramic bar sharpener which created a somewhat sharp but slightly uneven and pitted edge more akin to a micro-serrated edge than to the smooth, polished, razor’s edge that we associate with <em>seriously sharp</em> kitchen knives. Earlier this year, I came across a New York Times Book Review of the book titled <em>Sharp</em> by Josh Donald, immediately ordered it, and I have read this book multiple times. This led to the purchase of a set of <em>entry level</em> Japanese knives (Tojiro DP VG10 steel, <em>gyuto</em>, <em>petty</em>, <em>paring</em>, <em>serrated</em>), an entry level whetstone (Yae Tek 1000/6000 combination stone), a class on knife sharpening, then the purchase of a Naniwa sink bridge, a Naniwa stone holder, a set of three Naniwa Super Stones (so-called <em>wet and go</em> stones recently reformulated and re-branded as <em>Sharpening Stones</em> in 400, 1000, and 5000 grit), and a leather <em>strop paddle</em> (this deducted roughly 1K from our son’s inheritance). This segued into a shaving fixation moving away from disposable cartridge razors and cans of shaving gel towards safety and straight razors, shaving soap, badger hair soap brushes, alum blocks, and even commissioning a run of <em>shaving scuttles</em> from a local potter (the internationally renowned Master Potter and neighbour, Scott Barnim). I probably ought to also mention the foray into sharpening <em>serrated</em> knives (e.g., bread knives), which resulted in acquiring the indispensable <em>serrated tool</em> diamond files (DMT diafold coarse, fine, and extra fine diamond <em>rat tail files</em> to the rescue!). But I digress. Suffice it to say, sharp bread knives lead to thoughts of cutting bread: <em>seriously sharp knives</em> deserve nothing less than <em>seriously good bread</em> to cut. But not just any bread.</p>
<p>Around a decade ago I read two books by Michael Pollen, <em>The Omnivor’s Dilemma</em> and <em>In Defence of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto</em>. More recently, I binge-watched Pollen’s Netflix series <em>Cooked</em>, and was particularly intrigued by the <em>cold fire</em> known as <em>fermentation</em>—watching Pollen wax poetic about the history of sourdough bread planted the seed in my mind, and then Jen (whose name must mean <em>she who grudgingly indulges me</em>) and I bought a few loaves of a local artisinal olive sourdough bread, at which point the temptation to attempt to produce something similar at home got the better of me.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Not being the type who can dip only one toe into the ocean and emerge refreshed, I decided to go all in and take the plunge,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and asked (begged?) Jen for permission to get a KitchenAid stand mixer, then a set of bannetons for proving, then a Mockmill stand mixer attachment for stone milling whole grain flour at home, a set of jars for making my own sourdough starter from scratch, jars for storing hard flour, all purpose flour, the sourdough starter feed mix, <em>wheat berries</em> (raw, dried wheat kernels<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> that, when milled, become whole grain flour), etc., and I was off on an adventure (and our son’s inheritance was further depleted). I engaged in lots of online reading, video watching, and Jen bought me two books, one titled <em>Artisan Sourdough Made Simple: A Beginner’s Guide to Delicious Handcrafted Bread with Minimal Kneeding</em> by Emilie Raffa, followed by <em>Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast: The Fundamentals of Artisan Bread and Pizza</em> by Ken Forkish. The former is insufficiently detailed for me (Raffa skips the true autolyse step blending all ingredients at once) but her book contains some beautiful recipes and photos, while the latter is a bit unorthodox but more in line with my needs (no scoring, preference for extremely dark crusts baked at higher than conventional temperatures, but with a focus on temperature and volume I have not encountered elsewhere).</p>
<p>Getting the <em>starter culture</em> going in the cold Fall in Ontario, Canada, was a bit of a challenge, but we now have a healthy culture living in our kitchen (actually two, one that sat on the counter fed daily and one that lived mainly in the refrigerator fed weekly in case I accidentally killed either) and its offspring have been passed along to two friends to date (Jason, a neighbour, and Bettina and Zach, work colleagues).</p>
<p>My first attempts were utter failures—zero oven spring. I called the first loaf <em>Flat Stanley</em> given the uncanny resemblance of the loaf to the protagonist in author Jeff Brown’s famous children’s book series.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I was using a baking stone, and on subsequent attempts realized that I was doing everything wrong (the first attempts pre-dated reading the books mentioned above), but each failure contained a <em>teaching moment</em> when I re-evaluated my process with the benefit of hindsight aided by the fact that I kept detailed notes for each loaf baked. But subsequent attempts resulted in incremental improvements that prevented me from throwing in the towel, and I have baked a sufficient number of satisfactory <em>boules</em> (French for <em>round</em> loaf) and <em>batards</em> (French for <em>oblong</em> loaf) and, after much trial and error, can replicate the process and bake some <em>seriously good bread</em> (well, <em>good</em> is a relative construct, but we believe that it is as good or better than what we previously bought for 8 dollars CDN per loaf). There is a sense of almost pure joy associated with eating a piece of recently baked fermented bread in the morning, effortlessly cut with a hand sharpened serrated bread knife, garnished with a bit of cheese, homemade butter, or jam, bread made from scratch by miraculously harvesting <em>wild yeast</em> from thin air—flour, water, salt, and yeast—could anything else we might create be so simple yet so rewarding?</p>
<p>I wanted to summarize noteworthy details that I have gleaned in the hope that perhaps it might be of use to others, hence this post.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-sourdough" class="section level1">
<h1>A Brief History of Sourdough</h1>
<p>The origins of what today we refer to as <em>sourdough bread</em> have been traced back to ancient Egypt and appear to have spread from there. This nutritious miracle involves an organism that is omnipresent in the air that we all breathe, <em>wild yeast</em>, that has miraculously colonized a mixture of <em>wheat flour</em> and <em>water</em> in what was likely a bowl of porridge left neglected for a few days which, after being colonized, started bubbling with activity (<em>fermenting</em>) and then was placed in a hot oven at which time an amazing transformation took place, perhaps doubling in size and being easy to digest, not to mention tasty and exceptionally nutritious.</p>
<p>Though many associate <em>sourdough</em> with the taste of a popular San Francisco bread made from wheat flour (the famed <em>San Francisco Sourdough</em>), in fact <em>sourdough</em> refers to <em>any</em> bread made from a <em>wild yeast</em> starter or <em>levain</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> that undergoes a long and slow fermentation process in a series of carefully choreographed steps. Wheat, the most common grain used to make bread flour, is the most widely planted crop on the planet, and bread is a nutritional staple in every corner of the Earth—bread provides 20% of the daily protein and of the food calories for the Earth’s population. The sourdough process is the way bread was made for centuries, and is the way bread <em>ought</em> to be made, being infinitely preferable to <em>commercial</em> mass produced bread manufactured with <em>commercial flour</em> that has a long shelf life but lacks the nutritional value and natural wholesome goodness that arises from a long and slow sourdough fermentation involving <em>wild yeast</em> and <em>whole grain</em> flour (which contains the endosperm, bran, and germ, the latter not being present in commercial flour as it quickly spoils but is, in fact, the star of the show).</p>
<p>The following widely used commercial flours have the germ <em>and</em> bran removed, and are therefore <em>not</em> as nutritious as whole grain flours.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Bread flour</em> is made with <em>hard</em> wheat, which is high in protein (12-14%). The high protein in this flour makes it ideal for yeast breads.</p></li>
<li><p><em>All purpose flour</em> is made from a blend of <em>hard</em> and <em>soft</em> wheat grains and strikes the middle-ground in terms of protein (10-12%). It is used to make a variety of baked goods including muffins, cakes, pastries and waffles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Pastry</em> or <em>cake flour</em> is made with <em>soft</em> wheat, which is lower in protein (8-10%). The lower protein in this flour makes it ideal for making tender cakes, cookies, pastries and pasta.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="the-sourdough-process" class="section level1">
<h1>The Sourdough Process</h1>
<p><em>It all starts with the starter</em> as Yogi Berra might have remarked. Sourdough starter is a mix of flour and water colonized by wild yeast (<em>saccharomyces exiguus</em>) present in the air that we all breathe and colonized also by <em>lactobacilli</em>, bacteria present in flour that produce lactic and acetic acid (members of the lactic acid bacteria or LAB for short)—the two coexist in the levain in a proportion of roughly 1:100. The lactobacilli produce the acids that give the bread its tangy (<em>sour</em>) taste, while the yeast produce the CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> that creates the bubbles in the starter and, ultimately, in the baked boule.</p>
<p>Unlike making bread using commercial fast rising <em>monoculture</em> yeasts (<em>saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>) and commercial flours, making sourdough is less a quick <em>recipe</em> and more a lengthy <em>process</em>, so the impatient need not apply. I use the following process, but themes and variations abound and all seem to produce exceptional outcomes.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Begin by mixing the <em>autolyse</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> (a simple mix of flour and water in a particular ratio, know as the <em>hydration</em> of the dough—a 75% hydration means a 75:100 water:flour ratio).</p></li>
<li><p>After a short (or perhaps long) period of time during which the enzymes are being extracted, to the autolyse is added salt<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> (an important component) and some <em>starter culture</em> (the levain) whereupon the first ferment, called the <em>bulk ferment</em>, commences.</p></li>
<li><p>For a period of time (typically during the early part of the bulk ferment), a series of <em>folds-and-stretches</em> take place that set up the <em>gluten</em> alignment (gluten is a key element of an airy and light bread—the stretchy gluten form bubbles arising from the off-gassing of the yeast and bacteria), then typically four (or more) fold-and-stretches are undertaken in the first few hours until the dough <em>feels</em> right (i.e., resists further stretching).</p></li>
<li><p>After the bulk ferment is complete, i.e., when the dough has doubled (or tripled) in size, it then undergoes a preliminary shaping involving creating <em>surface tension</em> on the <em>boule</em> achieved by <em>dragging while turning</em> with the bench scraper, at which point we let it rest (covered) for a short period (30-60 minutes), then a final shaping takes place whereupon the boule is placed in a <em>proving basket</em> or <em>banneton</em> (a cane basket that helps the wet dough, which would collapse without support, to hold its shape while it undergoes a second rise) and undergoes a second and final ferment. This is known as the <em>second prove</em> (the first being the bulk ferment).</p></li>
<li><p>After a rest (<em>retard</em> in French) on the countertop and perhaps in a refrigerator overnight (or longer), the boule is removed from the banneton then <em>scored</em> on top with a <em>lame</em> (French for <em>blade</em>) thereby allowing it to expand properly when baked.</p></li>
<li><p>The scored boule is then baked, ideally in a Dutch Oven, for 50 minutes in a kitchen oven heated to roughly 450 degrees Fahrenheit (30 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, after being removed from the uncovered Dutch Oven, the boule is allowed to fully cool on a raised rack on the countertop. This is an extremely important part of the process that is not to be interrupted—flavours are developing, moisture is being pushed through the crust, and the cooling phase<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> is a key component of baking good bread (let it cool for <em>at least</em> 1 hour or more). If you do not place the boule on a rack and, instead, place it directly on the countertop, the bottom will become a wet mess of soggy dough (air needs to circulate all around the boule).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The video mentioned at the end of this post by Trevor J. Wilson is a very well-done 5 minute overview of the process and I highly recommend it for the uninitiated.</p>

<h1>A Whole Grain Sourdough Recipe (Kalamata Olives Optional)</h1>
<p>When the seed Michael Pollen inadvertently planted in my mind begin to germinate, I had a singular goal in mind, namely, to produce a bread at home every bit as good (or better) than what we had been paying 8 dollars CDN per boule for in a local store. I have much to learn and am not attempting to duplicate the exact taste, rather I am attempting to produce a bread at home that we both love to eat. Here is my existing recipe for a whole grain sourdough boule at 75% hydration (50% whole grain/whole wheat). There are three total weights given, a small boule (one that will fit an Eddington 750 gram banneton), medium, and large (the latter two will fit an Eddington 1 kilogram banneton). Each recipe differs by roughly 10% in pre-baked and final weight. The local ingredient cost-per-boule is roughly 2-3 dollars CDN (no Kalamata olives) or 4-5 dollars CDN otherwise (this includes the cost of the flour(s) used to feed the starter on a daily basis).</p>

<div id="my-weekend-baking-schedule" class="section level2">
<h2>My Weekend Baking Schedule</h2>
<p>Note that it is currently winter, and our kitchen temperature is 70F during the day, falling to a 60F low overnight. The schedule below allows me to start the process on a Friday night and have 2 loaves (double the recipe) for the week (make both at once, bake one after retarding overnight in the refrigerator, bake the other after retarding for a few days longer than the first, i.e., mid-week).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>6:30 pm: stone mill wheat berries, add 95F water, mix in your stand mixer<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> for 1-2 minutes on the lowest setting with a dough hook stirring until a <em>shaggy</em> ball of dough results and all of the flour is incorporated. Then leave the autolyse on the countertop overnight <em>covered</em> with plastic wrap (the starting dough temperature aimed for is around 78F).</p></li>
<li><p>7:30 am: use a warm water bath to bring the dough back to around 78F, achieved by placing the mixing bowl in a sink filled with a few inches of warm water for roughly 15 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>7:45 am: add the <em>starter</em> and <em>salt</em> to the autolyse and then mix the dough for 1-2 minutes in your stand mixer at the lowest setting using the dough hook, then <em>cover</em> with plastic wrap.</p></li>
<li><p>8:00 am: let the bulk fermentation commence with a set of stretch-and-folds (x4 or x6 occurring 30-45 minutes minutes apart, and <em>cover</em> with plastic wrap in between). If Kalamata olives are to be added, pat them dry with a paper towel then add 1/4 to the first fold, 1/4 to the second and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>6:00 pm: conduct the final stretch-and-fold to assist with removing the dough from the mixing bowl, <em>very lightly</em> dust the countertop with flour, shape and tension, then rest <em>covered</em> with plastic wrap.</p></li>
<li><p>7:00 pm: lightly dust an adjacent part of the countertop with flour, deposit the dough on the dusted countertop, then perform the final folding, shape, and tension which will produce a seam (bottom) and tight boule (top), then transfer to a banneton dusted with rice flour <em>seam side up</em> (this will be the bottom of the boule), and let rise at room temperature. <em>Cover</em> the banneton with a clear plastic bag to avoid evaporation and/or drying out.</p></li>
<li><p>10:00 pm: refrigerate at 37F.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can let the dough retard in the refrigerator anywhere from 12 to 36 hours at 37F (or longer, just keep an eye on things to avoid over-proving). We typically start Friday evening after work, bake the first boule Sunday morning, and bake the second Wednesday morning before heading to work, which lasts us through the following Saturday. Sourdough freezes beautifully, and we often cut a few slices and place them in an airtight container in the freezer and then pop them directly into the toaster when in need of a fresh fix.</p>
</div>
<div id="pro-tips" class="section level2">
<h2>Pro-Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Always hold back some of your starter to be fed and kept for the next session—20 grams or more is fine, I feed ours with an equal amount of water and starter mix (50 grams each). For weekly feeding, place the fed starter in the refrigerator, covered, and remove two days before needed and feed at least twice before using. I do the last feed prior to use just before going to bed after preparing the autolyse (for 2 loaves feed 25 grams of starter using 100 grams each of water and starter mix the night before—you can do this in a separate container from the one you keep your starter culture in if you prefer).</p></li>
<li><p>Ken Forkish advises us to treat <em>time</em> and <em>temperature</em> as ingredients (there is an inverse relationship between the two with regards to fermentation).</p></li>
<li><p>The key to an extended autolyse is to not let the dough get cold. When we are in the fermentation stage, a cold environment slows the rate of fermentation of bread, thus allowing flavors to develop. With the autolyse, the goal is to make the dough more extensible, and warmer temperatures help with this process. Why do we want extensible dough? Because extensible dough opens up more during baking, which is how we get that coveted <em>open crumb</em>. When the levain is added later, the acid will counter the extension benefits of autolyse, building and strengthening the dough. At the end of final fermentation, these two environments (autolyse, without added levain versus fermentation of the dough once levain is added) create a balanced dough that is both extensible and elastic.</p></li>
<li><p>Bulk ferment in a bowl and, when folding-and-stretching, perform this <em>in</em> the bowl by wetting the fingers of your dominant hand, gently reaching under half of the dough, then gently peeling it up and away from the bowl wall <em>leaving</em> the rest sticking to the wall, stretch until the attached dough has almost come away from the bowl wall, fold and rest on top of the part sticking to the wall, rotate the bowl 90 degrees (i.e., one quarter of a turn), then repeat three more times going <em>north</em>, <em>west</em>, <em>south</em>, <em>east</em> (i.e., counter clockwise).</p></li>
<li><p>Proving for an hour or two at room temperature gets the final rise going which is almost halted when retarding in the refrigerator at 37F—the aim is to get about 80% proved so that there is still <em>unspent fuel</em> present for <em>oven spring</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> to occur.</p></li>
<li><p>If adding, say, pitted (i.e., pitless) Kalamata olives, do so on the first fold after starting the bulk ferment (though you can also add them when you mix the autolyse, salt, and levain).</p></li>
<li><p>Use a Dutch Oven! During the first 10 minutes of the bake, steam plays a very important role by keeping the outer layer (eventually the crust) supple while the boule expands. Commercial bakers have special ovens with a steam feature, but the typical home oven does not, so steam must be introduced one way or another. Some use a spray bottle, others a pan with water in it, but these pale in comparison with using an oven designed for bread baking. However, if you trapped the moisture released by the dough during the first 10 minutes of baking, the hydration of a typical sourdough would create an environment almost identical to one found in an oven with a steam feature. And the Dutch Oven is perfect for trapping this moisture. In addition, sourdough boules tend to spread out as they bake, and an appropriately sized Dutch Oven (3-5 quarts with a 9-10 inch diameter base, such as the Lodge combo cooker) provides the additional support needed. So, by using a Dutch Oven you get greater oven spring (the extra support plus the steam) and a better crust to boot. Ken Forkish claims that he gets the same results using a Dutch Oven in his home oven as he does at his bakery. I have used a baking stone with water in a pan and have used a Dutch Oven, and hands down the Dutch Oven is the winner.</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-heat your kitchen oven with the Dutch Oven inside for at least 15 minutes (or more) <em>after</em> the oven reaches 450F before baking the boule.</p></li>
<li><p>When removing the boule from the banneton, first place the banneton on the countertop on top of parchment paper cut in shape of sling, next transfer the boule from the banneton to the parchment paper with a smooth <em>flip and tap</em> of the banneton’s edge on the countertop, score the boule, then gently lower the sling into the Dutch Oven (one nice side effect of using parchment is that there is no need to clean the Dutch Oven afterwards—the parchment collects any debris).</p></li>
<li><p>When scoring, rest your thumb and finger on the edge of the boule for stability, and score decisively–strive to be an artist, not a butcher. Scoring is not just to make a visually pretty design on the top of a boule. It is also how the baker controls the direction in which the boule expands. This impacts the shape of the boule cross section (rounder or more oval), the height of the boule, and whether it stays round or ends up more oblong.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the boule cool on a rack for a few hours, then place it inside of a paper bag (this allows the boule to breath and helps maintain a crispy crust). Leave it on the countertop for 1-2 days, then transfer to a bread storage bag (typically a cloth bag lined with a perforated plastic liner). The crust will remain firm, but the moisture does not evaporate as quickly in a bread bag—we keep loaves for up to a week using this process and it remains fresh and toasts beautifully.</p></li>
<li><p>Use high quality fresh ingredients, and play around with different wheat berries (hard white spring versus hard red fife)—it is amazing what a difference milling at home makes, and the whole wheat berry imparts exceptional flavour on the boule (and on the caramelized crust via a <em>Maillard reaction</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Use filtered or distilled water, or, if your tap water contains chlorine, let the tap water sit overnight on the countertop to allow the chlorine, which inhibits fermentation, to evaporate.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <em>rice flour</em> to dust your banneton before placing the boule in it. Nothing sticks to rice flour—not even the highest of hydration dough can overpower rice flour.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>Oscar Wilde remarked “The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it”, and I wholeheartedly subscribe to his sentiment.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>While living in Florida a few decades ago, a friend and Luthier in Tampa, Jerry Goolsby, offered me the opportunity to visit his workshop on Sundays where he would assist me with the making of an acoustic guitar, and I immediately accepted. I purchased and digested books on guitar making and the one bit of advice was to <em>never</em> attempt a <em>Florentine Cutaway</em> for one’s first attempt at making an acoustic instrument—naturally we made just such a beast.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>A wheat kernel is comprised of <em>endosperm</em> (approximately 83% of the kernel), <em>bran</em> (approximately 14.5% of the kernel), and the <em>germ</em> (approximately 2.5% of the kernel). The <em>endosperm</em> is the main source of <em>energy</em> for commercial white flour. It contains the greatest amount of carbohydrates, protein, and iron. It also contains some of the other B-vitamins as well. The <em>bran</em> is the outer skin of the edible kernel. It contains large amounts of B vitamins, some protein, trace minerals, phytochemicals, and dietary fibre. The <em>germ</em> is the sprouting section of the seed. It is usually separated during the milling process because it contains the most fat, and therefore has a shorter shelf life. It also contains a higher protein content, more B-vitamins, such as niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, and iron.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>While sleeping, Stanley Lambchop survived being <em>crushed flat</em> by a falling bulletin board. He makes the best of his altered state, and soon he is entering locked rooms by sliding under the door, being rolled up to go out to the park and playing with his younger brother by being used as a kite.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>This also dovetails with my obsession on academic preproducibility, reproducibility, and replicability.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p><em>Levain</em> is the French term for a mixture of flour and water that has been colonized by yeasts and bacteria.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>A friend and mutual windsurfing addict in a past life, John LaCombe, who learned to brew beer from his father, once remarked “You know, the worst beer I have ever made at home is better than the best beer I can buy in a bar.” He introduced me to the craft of home brewing from scratch and I can confirm that the same applies to the bread you can bake at home.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>During the autolyse, the flour absorbs the water, becoming fully hydrated. This activates enzymes in the flour that stimulate the proteins to start gluten development. At the same time, further enzymes are starting to break starch down into the simple sugars that will feed the yeast during the bulk fermentation.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>The functions of salt in baking include stabilizing the yeast fermentation rate, strengthening the dough, enhancing the flavor of the final product, and increasing dough mixing time.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>The five steps involved in making sourdough bread are 1) the autolyse, 2) the bulk ferment, 3) proving in a banneton, 4) baking, and 5) cooling (often neglected).<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>You can, of course, do this by hand, though it may take a little longer.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>As Emily Beuhler, author of <em>Bread Science</em> explains, oven-spring occurs primarily during the first ten minutes of baking. During these ten minutes, the yeast—feeling the coming heat—speed up their fermentation and respiration, belching out a final burst of CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>. As that CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> heats up, what was dissolved in our dough’s water comes out of solution. Like any gas, the CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> in our dough expands as it heats up. This same process occurs to the ethanol created by fermentation and a portion of the water mixed into our dough—i.e., they evaporate and expand upon heating. Since these gases are trapped inside our dough by the gluten matrix we formed during our mixing and fermentation stages, as they expand, so does our bread. It’s this expansion that causes our dough to leap upwards and outwards while in the oven. This is what oven-spring is, and we want as much as we can get.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
