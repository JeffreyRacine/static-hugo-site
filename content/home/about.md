# Biography

I am a Professor in the Department of Economics and a Professor in the Graduate Program in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University. I occupy the Senator William McMaster Chair in Econometrics and is a Fellow of the Journal of Econometrics. I have held previous appointments at Syracuse University, the University of South Florida, the University of California San Diego (two-year visiting appointment), and York University.

My research interests include nonparametric estimation and inference, shape constrained estimation, cross-validatory model selection, frequentist model averaging, nonparametric instrumental methods, and entropy-based measures of dependence and their statistical underpinnings. I am also interested in parallel distributed computing paradigms and their application to computationally intensive nonparametric estimators.

I am currently serving as an Associate Editor for Econometric Reviews and as the Deputy Editor-in-Chief for Econometrics.
