# About This Site

This website exists to facilitate discussion about any manner of things, academic or otherwise. If this site has a bias, it is likely towards open and free computing technology that streamlines workflow, particularly tools for pursuing reproducible research. One difference between this site and my [primary academic website](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/people/racinej) is the presence of a blog that presents a forum for further discussion in the public sphere.

If you are searching for working papers, information about R packages I have authored, a curriculum vitae, course information and the like, kindly [visit my primary McMaster academic website](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/people/racinej).

# About Me

I am a Professor in the Department of Economics and a Professor in the Graduate Program in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University, which is located in Southern Ontario, Canada. I occupy the Senator William McMaster Chair in Econometrics and am a Fellow of the Journal of Econometrics. I have held previous appointments at Syracuse University, the University of South Florida, the University of California San Diego (two-year visiting appointment), and York University.

My research interests include nonparametric estimation and inference, shape constrained estimation, cross-validatory model selection, frequentist model averaging, nonparametric instrumental methods, and entropy-based measures of dependence and their statistical underpinnings. I am also interested in parallel distributed computing paradigms and their application to computationally intensive nonparametric estimators.

I am currently serving as an Associate Editor for Econometric Reviews and as the Deputy Editor-in-Chief for Econometrics.
